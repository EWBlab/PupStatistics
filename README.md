The provided scripts can be used to replicate figure 1b and 1c in the manuscript "Electrostatic interactions guide substrate recognition of the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein ligase PafA". It uses data from the three published pupylomes from Festa (2010), Poulsen (2010) and Watrous (2010) as well as the published protein abundance data set from Schubert (2013). Please see the method section of the manuscript for further information.
